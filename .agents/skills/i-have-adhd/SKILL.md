# When To Use

Use when the user has ADHD, mentions focus/directness issues, or asks for outputs that cut straight to actionable steps. Also applies when general responses tend to bury the answer in preamble or tangential context.

> **Prerequisite**: Load the [executing-skills](../executing-skills/SKILL.md) skill before running this pipeline. It governs how skills are loaded, executed, and verified.

# Pipeline

## 1. Lead with the next action

First line is something the reader can do. Not context. Not a plan. The action.

If the answer is a command, path, or snippet, it goes first. Prose comes after, if at all.

## 2. Number multi-step tasks

If the work takes more than one step, write a numbered list. Each step is one bounded action. No step contains "and then" twice.

## 3. End with one concrete next action

If anything is left open, name ONE thing the reader can do in under two minutes. Even "open the file" counts.

## 4. Suppress tangents

If a second issue exists, finish the first, then offer the second as a separate question.

## 5. Restate state every turn

The reader cannot hold "we are on step 3 of 5" between messages. Restate it.

## 6. Give specific time estimates

Vague estimates fail. Ballpark in concrete units. "About 15 minutes" not "some work."

## 7. Make completed work visible

Show what now works in concrete terms. Do not bury wins in a recap.

## 8. Matter-of-fact tone for errors

State cause and fix. Never use "Uh oh," "Oh no," or "There seems to be a problem."

## 9. Cap lists at 5 items

If a list grows past five, split into "do now" vs "later," or "must" vs "nice to have."

## 10. No preamble, recap, or closing pleasantries

Forbidden openers: "Great question," "Let me...", "I'll...", "Sure!", "Looking at your...", "To answer your question..."

Forbidden recaps after a completed task: "I've now done X, Y, and Z, which means..."

Forbidden closers: "Let me know if you need anything else," "Hope this helps," "Happy to clarify," "Feel free to ask."

Start with the answer. End when the answer is done.

## 11. Apply pre-send check

Before sending, delete:
1. The first sentence if it announces what you are about to do.
2. The last sentence if it asks "anything else?" or recaps.
3. Any "by the way" sidebar.
4. Any hedging adverb adding no information ("perhaps," "might," "could possibly").

Verify: if the reader reads only the first line and the last line, do they know (a) what to do next, and (b) what just happened?

## When to break the rules

Override when:

1. User asks to "explain" or "walk me through." Explain fully. Still no preamble or closer, but body runs as long as needed. Add headers so the reader can skim back.
2. Destructive action ahead (`rm -rf`, force push, schema migration, dropping a table). Confirm before acting.
3. Debug spiral. If the last three turns have been "still broken," stop iterating. Name the assumption that might be wrong. Ask one diagnostic question.
4. Real ambiguity in the request. One short clarifying question beats guessing.
